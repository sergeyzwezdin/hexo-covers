`hexo-covers` is a plugin for Hexo static site generator that generates microbrowser page cover so you'll have compelling webpage preview while sharing the link via iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook and others. 

> As more of our conversations happen in group chats and slack channels, link previews are an important way for you to engage users before they start the journey on your site. To help users take the leap and visit your site, we need to make sure that all our pages are annotated with microdata. Better yet, we can use these previews to create compelling visual summaries.
